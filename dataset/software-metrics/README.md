# Diagram Metrics
This folder contains the calculated software metrics (as a CSV file) for the [Java Websockets](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket) and [Mobile Media](https://github.com/julioserafim/MobileMedia) codebase. The different versions of the same codebase are combined in one file. So that there is one `software-metrics.csv` file for each repository.

The metrics are calculated by well-researched and widely used tools like [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/) and [JArchitect](https://www.jarchitect.com/).

# Content
Using the table below, it is possible to directly go to the software metrics for a specific repository.

> *Note that the first line of each CSV file specifies the metrics presented in each column. The first column in each CSV file specifies the specific software version used for the software metrics in that specific row. There are two special rows named 'tools' (which specifies which program was used for that specific metric) and 'comment' (which tells more about the metric, which tool we used, and how we decided to select/combine a metric).*
