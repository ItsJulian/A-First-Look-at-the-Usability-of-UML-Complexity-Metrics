# Class Diagrams
This folder contains the created class diagram (as XML file) for each version of the [Java Websockets](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket) and [Mobile Media](https://github.com/julioserafim/MobileMedia) codebase. 

The tool [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/) was used to create these diagrams and can also be used to import the XML files. 

The `.analyzer.txt` files (included for each class diagram file) are created by a custom tool to help determine the correctness of the diagrams.
